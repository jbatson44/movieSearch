# movieSearch

Vue app to allow searching and displaying results from Open Movie Database
If I had more time I would:
* Validate the user text input to prevent bad input (code injection etc.)
* store the api key in a safer spot
* fix the pagination so that it wouldn't show every page. Instead have the first and last pages as well as a max of 2 page above and below the current page
* store recent searches to allow the user to quickly use them again
* improve the overall styling

## Recommended IDE Setup
